# SCUT-DHGA
This is the official repository of "Dynamic Hand Gesture Authentication Dataset and Benchmark".

## Dataset
We introduce a new dataset **SCUT-DHGA** which is the first large-scale Dynamic-Hand-Gestures authentication dataset. SCUT-DHGA contains 29,160 dynamic-hand-gesture video sequences and more than 1.86 million frames for both color and depth modalities acquired from 193 volunteers. Six kinds of dynamic hand gestures are carefully designed: 1)make a fist starting from thumb, 2)rotate hand while making a fist starting from little finger, 3)catch and then release, 4)four fingers(index, middle, ring, little) touching thumb one by one, 5)bend four fingers(same as 4)) one by one, 6)open a fist starting from thumb.

Now a small part of our dataset containing both depth and color gesture videos from *five* subjects can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12vp-6o1gIJLfcw492EJILIXNqxAIcwRU/view?usp=sharing).Note that the depth data is 8-bit in this demo version. The 16-bit depth data will be released soon in our complete dataset.
